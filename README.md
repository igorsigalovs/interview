# Exercise1

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.4.

## Problems
- The tests are failing. Fix the application so the tests pass.
- The client wants to see the titles set to "Exercise 1 - Homepage" on the homepage and "Exercise 1 - About Us" on the About Us page. This can be set anywhere and doesn't need to be tested.
- The toolbar cuts off information on the About Us page. It should follow the content properly. So when the user scrolls the content, the toolbar stays on top of the screen and above all the content.
- The SPA seems to reload the application on route change. Investigate and fix the issue.
- The routes do not indicate which route is currently active in the toolbar. Increase the font size to 1.125rem when a route is active.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
