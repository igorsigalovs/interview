# Exercise1

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.4.

## Problem
1. The tests are blowing up. Fix the application so the tests can pass.
3. The client wants see the titles and them to be "Exercise 1 - Homepage" on the homepage and to be on "Exercise 1 - About us" on the page you just fixed.
Can be set anywhere, doesn't need to be tested.
3. The toolbar seems to cut off information on about us page. It also should follow the content properly.
4. The routes do not indicate which route is currently active route in the toolbar. Increase the font size by 0.25rem when it is active.
4. The SPA seem to reload the application on route change. Investigate and fix the issue.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
